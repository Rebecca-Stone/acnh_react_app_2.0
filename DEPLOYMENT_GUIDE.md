# ACNH React App - Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. ESLint Warnings Resolved

- Fixed unused variables in `AnimalContent.js`, `HamburgerMenu.js`, and `unifiedFilter.js`
- Fixed accessibility issue in `UnifiedSearch.js` (added proper ARIA attributes for combobox role)
- Build now compiles successfully with no warnings

### 2. Vercel Configuration Added

- Created `vercel.json` with proper React SPA configuration
- Added `.vercelignore` to optimize deployment bundle size
- Configured proper routing for single-page application

### 3. Bundle Optimization

- Current gzipped bundle size: 82.18 kB (within reasonable limits)
- Large data file (`realVillagers.json` - 312KB) is manageable but could be optimized further

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with your GitHub account
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository: `Rebecca-Stone/acnh_react_app_2.0`
4. Vercel will auto-detect it's a React app
5. Use these build settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `build`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
6. Deploy!

### Option 2: Deploy via CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally (if not already installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### If deployment still fails:

#### 1. Large Bundle Size

The `realVillagers.json` file (312KB) might cause issues. Consider:

```bash
# Option A: Move to public folder and fetch dynamically
mv src/data/realVillagers.json public/data/
# Then update imports to fetch from /data/realVillagers.json

# Option B: Compress the data
# Minify the JSON or use data compression
```

#### 2. Memory Issues

If you get memory errors, add this to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096 react-scripts build"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Function Size Limits

If the bundle is too large for Vercel's serverless functions, the current `vercel.json` configuration treats it as a static site, which should resolve this.

## Environment Variables (if needed)

If your app uses environment variables, add them in Vercel Dashboard:

- Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
- Add variables prefixed with `REACT_APP_`

## Build Verification âœ…

Local build test passed successfully:

```
Compiled successfully.
File sizes after gzip:
  82.18 kB  build/static/js/main.b7570462.js
  10.94 kB  build/static/css/main.c7b60d69.css
```

## Next Steps

1. Try deploying with the fixes applied
2. If you still encounter issues, share the specific error message from Vercel's build logs
3. The deployment should now work successfully! ðŸš€
